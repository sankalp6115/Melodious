[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold, have a seat
In the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughin' in my classes
While I was schemin' for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smilin' from the stage while
You were clappin' in the nosebleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder

[Bridge]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder (Never give up, never give up)
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder (Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Never give up, never give up)
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder (Never give up on your dreams)

[Outro]
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder (Woo)
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
