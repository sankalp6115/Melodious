[Verse 1]
Say I'm cold-hearted
But I'm just gettin' started
Got my eyes on the target
Now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)
'Til the battles won
'Til kingdom come
(Oh, oh, oh)
I'll never run

[Chorus]
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm takin' the world you'll see
They'll be callin' me, callin' me
They'll be callin' me royalty
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm takin' the world you'll see
They'll be callin' me, callin' me
They'll be callin' me royalty

[Drop]
They'll be callin' me royalty

[Verse 2]
They say I'm dangerous, 'cause I
Broke all the cages
No I, won't sit and take it
Now, now
They left me for dead, I guess they'll never learn
Every time I break there's just more pain to burn
They'll never, never, never learn

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)
'Til the battles won
'Til kingdom come
(Oh, oh, oh)
I'll never run

[Chorus]
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm takin' the world you'll see
They'll be callin' me, callin' me
They'll be callin' me royalty
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm takin' the world you'll see
They'll be callin' me, callin' me
They'll be callin' me royalty

[Drop]
They'll be callin' me royalty
They'll be callin' me royalty

[Outro]
Callin' me royalty
Callin' me
They'll be callin' me royalty
Callin' me royalty
Callin' me
